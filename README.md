# My first game prototype made with Unreal.

The goal of this project was to learn to use the Unreal engine, as well as practice C++.
The result is aesthetically ugly but I did manage to make some cool third person platformer movement gameplay mechanics.

## Project Goals

- [x] Learn to navigate the Unreal Editor
- [x] Get a refresher on C++
- [x] Learn the types of objects and classes that are used in game development for Unreal
- [x] Implement third person platforming gameplay
- [x] Create classes and objects in C++ to use in the prototype
- [x] Learn the relation between C++ classes and Unreal's Blueprint system
- [x] Create and release some form of playable project (this prototype right here ðŸ˜Š)
